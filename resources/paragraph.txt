In the precomputing era, search technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as
the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for.
Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words)
has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as latent semantic indexing
have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.
